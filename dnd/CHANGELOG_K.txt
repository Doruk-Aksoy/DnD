! New feature
* Bugfix / Tweak

=====================
== DND RPG RELATED ==
=====================

! Backpacks can also drop chests now!
! "Heavy Missile Launcher" can now shoot non-homing missiles using the altfire.
! "Bulkiness" now increases armor cap by 4.
! "Strength" increases armor and health cap by 0.5% per point.
- "Strength" no longer increases armor cap by 4.
! The ability to dash now uses a new key. Bind this, and use it while on the move to gain a burst of speed in the direction you're moving.
	- Due to the flexibility added to the dash, a few things are nerfed:
		- Dash cooldown is increased to 35 tics from 27.
		- Dash speed reduced to 12.0 from 20.0.
		- There's a necessary input delay of 3 tics. (Prevents spamming the ability)
* Stat descriptions on "DnD Menu" is now written below them instead of the corner.
* "Bulkiness" percentage value on stat menu now uses correct formula. (It used the older formula)
* Grouped loadout pages into one section, just like the shop section for weapons.
* Chest open messages are only visible to the player trying to open them now.
* "Natural Talent" quest now properly checks if you have used a talented weapon.
* Hopefully fixed an abuse related to "Hardcore" and exiting maps while dying.
* Fixed a bug that prevented you from switching special ammo mode despite having ammo in the magazine.
* "Necro Armor" spikes go through players now.
* "Necro Armor" spikes now deal full damage if "Nether Mask" is equipped.
* "Strength" and "Bulkiness" stats now correctly mention they increase your knockback resist.
* Fixed a problem related to chest drops and respawning items.
* Fixed a bug where "Violence Orb" bonuses weren't included in damage calculation.
* Reworked damage scaling calculation to use integers instead of fixed point. This should eliminate overflows and allow you to reach higher damage outputs for each damage source.
* Adjusted hitboxes of all grenades.
* The numbers shown for "Credit" and "Exp" gain bonuses at stat menu are now correct.
* Fixed a typo that stated "Intellect" stat gave 0.15% bonus of talent. (Gives 0.1% still)
* New accessories of previous version do drop now. Oops.
* You can't use "Portable Shield" with "Invulnerability Sphere" anymore.
* "Destruction Generator" knockback is now properly remedied with "Gryphon Boots".
* Fixed one of the "Wanderer" player sprites not translating properly.
* Fixed some bugs related to accessories using powerups not having their effects save properly.
* Reduced the scale on one of the research sprites.
* Reworked research dropping: You now only see one research drop and every other player will also see only their drop.
* "Necro Armor" now scales from "Intellect" instead of "Dexterity".
* Cleaned up scaling code of "Necro Armor".
* "Demon Heart" now properly uses ammo when "Hand of Artemis" is used.
* Fixed a bug where damage type bonuses weren't saved properly to the database in "Hardcore" and "Softcore" modes.
* Fixed a bug where "Heavy Grenade Launcher" let you shoot 2 grenades without loading if you had "Nether Mask" equipped.
* Elite default spawn level is now 20 in both "Hardcore" and "Softcore" modes.
* Fixed a bug where armor bonuses did not increase your armor after reaching that armor's capacity.
* Fixed a small problem regarding chest drop rates.
* Fixed old damage method for "Soul Reaver" when "Nether Mask" was equipped. This results in equal damage when it's equipped instead of a bit less.
* Fixed a bug that caused "Lich Arm" to actually reduce damage of all weapons... oops.
+ "Hardcore" and "Softcore" damage amp reduced to 15% from 25%.
+ Monster damage values in "Hardcore" and "Softcore" now scale by 4% instead of 5%.
* "Natural Talent" bonus is now properly applied to all damage types.
+ "Armor Bonus" now increases your armor up to x3 of the capacity of that armor, plus the bonuses.
+ "Celestial Relic" now slows by 20% down from 25%.
- "Chest Key" drop rate reduced to 1.5% from 2.5.
- "Necro Armor" now uses new talent scaling values instead of old ones. (This is a bit of a nerf)
+ Fixed a bug that caused "Savagery" to give only 1% bonus to crit damage instead of 10%.
+ Health and armor caps increased to 32k.
- "Destruction Generator" primary ball explosion radius reduced to 384, full damage radius reduced to 192. (Reduced by 50%)
	- This is only the portion that hurts the player. The majority of the damage has the old radius and still doesn't hurt the player.
* "Destruction Generator" now hurts players on direct ball hit properly. (Previously it only hurt if you had "Explosion Mastery")
