=================================
== INVENTORY SYSTEM AND CHARMS ==
=================================

* Inventory system brings you the classic RPG experience with inventory management and stuff to carry around!
* You can access this system in your loadout. It has 5 new sections: "Inventory", "Stash", "Charms", "Crafting" and "Trading".
* To pick any item you find on the floor, simply press "Use" while on top of them. You can omit pressing this to instead inspect the item.
* Multiple item types have been turned to utilize this new system. "Orbs" and "Chest Keys" are some of those.
* All inventory drop rolls are player instanced. This means, at every monster death your luck is rolled. Some players might get drops while others don't.

Note: In the following contexts, left and right clicks imply your "fire" and "altfire" keys respectively.

1. Inventory

	- This is your basic inventory, a 5 x 9 grid. You can store your items acquired through your gameplay here.
	- You can move things by left clicking on them once and clicking another place to put them in.
	- To drop the items, simply left click them and click outside the inventory box. (The gray outline)
	- If items have stacks, you can do as follows:
		- Halve the stack by left clicking on the item followed by a right click.
		- Simply take one out of the stack by right clicking without any left clicks.
	- This information is wiped out if you die in "Hardcore" mode.
	- For any kind of "Crafting", this place will be used as reference and not your "Stash".

2. Stash

	- This is your storage. You can put whatever you feel like in here.
	- This place supports 10 additional stash tabs you can purhcase. You can do so in the Research Menu's "Utility" section.
	- The items in here are NOT wiped out if you die in "Hardcore".
	- You can buy new stash tabs after you discover a required research.
	- New stash tabs are bought from the new "Account Menu" section of the shop.

3. Charms

	- This is the current state of the inventory stuff. For proof of concept, there are only charms to be used at the moment.
	- 3 types of charms exist: "Small", "Medium" and "Grand".
	- You can select any of the boxes to put a charm in there using left click.
	- When you select a box it'll show you a view of your inventory. Any charm selected will be used.
	- You can only use a charm fit for the spot. Ex: You can't place a "Grand" charm in place of a "Medium" charm etc.
	- Small charms can have at most 2 attributes, medium 3 and grand 5.
	- The values on attributes are rolled depending on the item level. Item level is hidden, but there are tiers based on the item's level to simplify.
	- There are 5 item tiers at every 25 levels. At 100 level, the item rolls perfect values.
	- You'll see a different prefix on the charms depending on their tier, so you can tell their roll quality easier.
	- There are plenty of new attributes to play around! Explore!
	- To unequip, simply use altfire on the charm slot.
	
4. Crafting

	- Crafting is done with orbs for the time being. There are some orbs that help you craft your charms!
	- You can simply left click on an item to craft and then right click on the material of your choosing to use it on the item.
	- If the material requires no target to be used on simply right click on it to use.

Note: If you move an item after it's been crafted, that item will no longer be eligible for an "Orb of Repentance".
The above includes moving it around in inventory, putting it to stash or putting it up for trade.

5. Trading

	- You can send a trade request to players by left clicking on their names.
	- If the player has a red "X" next to them, that means that player isn't available for trading.
	- If the player has a red "M" next to them, that means you muted that player for trade requests.
	- If the player as a black "M" next to them, that means that player has muted you for trade requests.
	- You can mute players by right clicking on their names.
	- If a player has sent you a trade request and it's pending, you'll see a cyan "V" symbol next to their name.
	- Left clicking on a pending trade request will take you to trade view.
	- You can place items to trade panel simply by following the usual item moving rules. You can only move items from your "Inventory".
	- After you're done, press "Confirm". If both players press "Confirm", a countdown of 5 seconds will go. At the end, the items will be traded.
	- If for whatever reason you exit menu or press "Cancel" to quit the trade view, press "Confirm" again to change your mind, the trade will be cancelled.
	- At map exits all trade deals are broken regardless of their countdown state. Items will not be transferred!
	- If you die while you're trading it will be broken as well.
	- Values of items can vary, depending on what they contain. As of this moment there is no way to trade credits or budget.
