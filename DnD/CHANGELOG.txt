==== DND 2022 APRIL 1ST EDITION v2.5 PATCH NOTES ====

* Added NFTs. (See Shop)
* Added new perk "Brutality".
	- 5% increased melee damage and 8% increased melee range per rank.
	- "Sharpshooting" no longer affects melee weaponry.
* You gain a mastery when you allocate maximum points (10) to a perk!
	- Sharpshooting: Dexterity gives 4% damage per point instead of 3%.
	- Brutality: Melee damage and range increase also applies to projectiles fired from melee weapons.
	- Endurance: Damage going to armor has 10% chance to be completely negated.
	- Wisdom: Gain experience from kills regardless of the killer or the range limit.
	- Greed: Gain credit from kills regardless of the killer or the range limit.
	- Medic: Convert 10% of healing pickups to extra armor.
	- Munitionist: Enemies have 2% chance to drop ammo tokens, giving 10% ammo to a random weapon you own.
	- Deadliness: Every 7th hit you land within four seconds is a guaranteed critical strike.
	- Savagery: 100% to crit multiplier if you haven't dealt a critical strike in 5 seconds.
	- Luck: When an item drops there's a 25% chance to get an additional item drop of its type.
* You can now invest into a research to increase its odds of dropping.
	- All research icons, cost etc. are visible from the start, but you still can't research them without the blueprints.
	- Until you get the blueprint, you can invest to add 1% chance to drop for a research per investment.
	- Investment uses credits.
	- You invest a base amount of 1000, and an additional 5% + 15% of the budget cost of that research per investment on top of your previous investment cost.
		+ Formula basically becomes: 
		+ Example: Research cost is 50k. You invest once, its 1000. The second time its 1125. Third time its 1406. ((1125 + (100 + (5 + 15*50/100) * 2)) / 100)
		+ Please note that precision errors apply due to integer math, so expected values may vary to be lower than shown in this example.
	- Maximum is (obviously) 100% drop chance.
	- If you pick the blueprint, you can no longer invest as it's pointless.
	- The drop chance is calculated on YOUR investment, other players' investments do not matter. This includes the hit that kills a monster or chests opened by players.
	- You can't invest in research that is obtained from specific monsters, through their unique drops or otherwise.

* "Elemental Bulwark" can cast a random elemental spell once every 5 seconds now up from 1.5 seconds.
* All sorts of "increased X damage" modifiers are now ADDITIVE instead of MULTIPLICATIVE. The only multiplicative instances of such damage left are:
	- Weapon specific stacking properties (such as Lightning Gun's stacking damage over time)
	- Sharpshooting and Brutality perks.
	- Quest or Accessory bonuses. (Demon Bane etc.)
	- Example: If you were to do 100 damage with two instances of 75% increased damage, now you'll do 250 damage instead of 306 (306.25 rounded down) damage.
	- Damage over time multipliers. (It's in their name, duh)
	- Critical strikes.
* Improved weapon mod and stat descriptions in crafting menu.
* Added "sp_softcore" and "sp_hardcore" commands. These set the game to you so that the rules are from softcore or hardcore but there are no database functions and no account loading stuff.
	- This is best used in SP or Local Server where you are the only player.

* Reworked how damage dealing works. This uses a completely new overhauled system that is untraditional, but allows for new features, such as:
	- Determining who deals how much damage at any point in the game.
	- Damage numbers without taxing the server.
	- Lifesteal with custom % or conditions.
	- Resistance penetration, ignoring, conditional penetration etc. on a much higher customization.
	- The creation of the poison system!
	- Hit beeps when hitting a resistant, immune or an invulnerable monster. Also beeps for hitting monsters that have a particular weakness. (Controlled by dnd_hitbeeps client cvar)
	- Custom vector based push system on damage.
	- Damage numbers! Can be turned off from clients' side with "dnd_dmgnum" CVar.

* The above system fixed some issues, such as:
	- Shotgun damage range is now outputting the intermediate values, not just each extreme. (Example: Shotgun used to only deal 100 or 150 damage. It can do intermediate values now)
	- Damage scaling accuracy has increased significantly.
	- Forced delay on exploding puff damage method. That is now gone completely.
	- Taltos Ring not healing above a certain threshold of health.
	- Blood Rune artifact not healing above a certain threshold of health.

* As a consequence of the above system, some limitations arose. These are:
	- Sun Staff no longer has a projectile and rail counterpart for FULL damage buffs. It always fires the rail counterpart, but with a little less damage to compensate. 64 damage per hit.
	- Reflected projectiles do not deal any initial damage to reflecting monsters anymore. This requires a rework of how reflects occur and it's not a priority at the moment.
	- Now that Taltos Ring heals you for your real health, it's percentage is reduced to 25% from 50%.
	- Same with Taltos Ring, Blood Rune lifesteal percentage dropped to 30%. However the Arcanery ability now improves this percentage to 45%.

* Reworked BFG attacks. The tracers now deal a known damage, and the formula is as follows:
	- Damage scales from 100% of a tracer to 0% through the distance proportional to the square of the distance.
	- Max distance of most BFG Scan style attacks is 1024. You deal the most damage the closer you are, and least the farther you are.
	- No randomness anymore.
	- As a result, certain BFG attacks have been re-adjusted. Overall reliability of the BFG type attacks have increased significantly.
	- Damage scaling effectiveness of tracers is 66%.
	- BFG weapons attack rate nerfed, and ammo use increased to 50 and 75 respectively for 6000 and 32768 versions of BFG. They also can hit at most 30 monsters at a time.
	
* Rewrote how Bulkiness works:
	- Now armor efficiency no longer grants damage reduction behind the scenes.
	- Instead it properly reduces the hit your armor specifically takes from damages.
		+ Example: Taking a hit for 100 damage with an armor doing 50% reduction will take 50 armor off of you. If you have 20% armor efficiency, you only lose 40 armor instead.

* Lifesteal now works as follows:
	- It is not instant (unless special conditions apply).
	- It has a buffer that is 20% of your maximum health capacity.
	- Any damage that'd be stolen as life is instead filling this buffer.
	- This buffer is periodically reduced by 1% of your maximum health cap to heal you.
	- You can increase all these effects through item mods.
* Monsters now take 50% less damage when they have "Physical Resist" mod instead of 25%. Melee is not changed.
* All resist modifiers on monsters now imply 50% damage reduction, up from 25%.
* Shotgun style weapons that rely on "pellet count" calculations have crit chance calculated as a whole, not just per pellet now.
	- The above includes weapons like "Plasma Cannon" as well. Shots fired from this weapon, should a crit roll, all projectiles will be affected.

* Added a new player inflicted poison system. Poison from players deal 2% of the overall poison damage dealt in the given hit to the monster every poison tic as additional damage.
	- Base duration is 3 seconds.
	- Poison damage tics every 0.5 seconds.
	- Can stack up to 5 times on a given monster, regardless of player.
	- If a monster has max stacks, no further stacks apply. Once a stack is done dealing its damage, then new stacks can be applied further.

* All ice attacks can now apply "Chill" and "Freeze".
	- Chill is inflicted per 10% missing health a monster has when hurt by ice attacks.
	- Chill has a max stack of 5, each applying a 10% slow.
	- Chill stacks last for a second. Monsters lose a stack every second.
	- At any chill stack, a monster can be frozen if hit with ice attacks. Freeze chance is 2% per stack.
	- Frozen monsters can't retaliate for 3 seconds. Bosses are only affected for one third of this effect.
	
* All fire attacks can now "Ignite".
	- Ignite sets a monster on fire, dealing flat fire damage.
	- Base chance to ignite is 15%.
	- Base damage for all ignite tics is 10.
	- Ignite tics over 4 seconds with 5 tics every second.
	- New ignites refresh duration.
	
* All lightning attacks can now "Overload".
	- Base chance to overload is 5%.
	- Overloaded enemies take 20% more damage from any non-lightning based damage.
	- If an overloaded enemy is killed, nearby enemies are overloaded within 512 units (up to 128 enemies).
	- Overload effect lasts for 3 seconds.
	- Bosses are affected for half the duration only.
	
* New item mods:
	- Cybernetic.
	- Melee range increase.
	- Resist penetration for all damage categories.
	- Lifesteal.
	- Blocking enemies take % extra damage from attacks.
	- Flat damage bonuses to fire, ice, poison and lightning.
	- Increased effect of chill, increased chance to freeze enemies and reduced enemy chill threshold.
	- Increased poison ticrate, damage per tic, duration.
	- Increased chance to ignite, increased ignite damage, increased ignite duration.
	- Increased chance to overload, increased overload reflection damage, additional overload reflections.
	- Increased damage over time.
	- Damage over time multiplier.
	- Reduced hitscan damage taken.
	- Reduced energy damage taken.
	- Reduced explosion damage taken.
	- Reduced magic damage taken.
	- Reduced fire damage taken.
	- Reduced ice damage taken.
	- Reduced lightning damage taken.
	- Reduced poison damage taken.
	- Maximum damage resist cap.
	- Increased regeneration rate.
	- Increased lifesteal rate.
	- Increased life recovery from lifesteal.
	- Increased lifesteal cap.
	- More damage while lifestealing.
	- Added duration to overload.
